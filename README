How to run Origamist?

* Open command line in this directory and type:
    java -jar OrigamistViewer.jar
    or
    java -jar OrigamistEditor.jar

* Edit one of the .jnlp files - the "codebase" attribute must carry the absolute path to the .jnlp file; then, double-click the file and Origamist will start.

* You can run Origamist as applet by opening preview.html or preview-editor.html, but the aforementioned edit of .jnlp files is needed.

* There are Ant targets to run Origamist:
    * ant run-appletviewer-viewer
    * ant run-browser-viewer
    * ant run-jnlp-viewer
    * ant run-appletviewer-editor
    * ant run-browser-editor
    * ant run-jnlp-editor
(prepend just- befor the target's name to only run Origamist without recompiling)
