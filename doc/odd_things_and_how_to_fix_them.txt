This file contains a list of odd things I encountered during the development
of the Origamist project. It also contains workarounds or solutions to get rid
of these oddities.

------------

JTree disappears after some nodes are expanded:

------------

The maximum and minimum sizes of a JScrollPane (and probably of most of Swing
components) are not taken into account by some Swing layout managers. You
must set the preferred size instead. If you only want to fix one dimension,
set the other dimension to 0.

Java3D needs some native libraries (.so or .dll files). They cannot be loaded
in the same way as JAR libraries. There are some ways to include them without
installation on the host computer on the web, but all of them have seemed to
be broken since JDK 1.6.0_20. So I had to write custom ClassLoader and use a
bootstrapping technique (Java3DBootstrappingApplet). The classloader loads
the native libraries from the specified path. It would be a big problem if I
tried to set the default classloader to the custom one (particulary it is IMHO
impossible for applets in a general way). So that's why the bootstrapping 
technique (the bootstrapper is loaded by the default CL and then it uses the
custom CL to load and instantiate my applet).

If you want to display custom tooltips for items in a JTree, you must call
setToolTipText("") on the JTree, or getToolTipText(MouseEvent event) won't
even be called!

Do you want a toolbar button with the down arrow on the right, which pops up
a submenu when clicked? No luck with Java SE classes! You must develop your
own. Some frameworks have these buttons, too (SwingX, Flamingo). If you don't
want to use a framework, then the best implementation is to be found at
mammothsoftware.com under LGPL, but that site doesn't exist this time, so you 
have to find it in an internet archive.
