Writing Origamist has been a great experience, I have taught a lot of things not only about programming. A common sheet of paper can get very interesting in the while one begins to think about the mathematics and physics it is affected by. Some of these phenomenons are big algorithmic problems, whereas others have a surprisingly simple answer. 

If I should look into the future of Origamist, it has a stable, extendible and promising application base, but the folding algorithms need to be developed to much higher detail. Folding advanced models is still nearly impossible in Origamist (due to the lack of the Open operation, which is broadly used), and the floating-point rounding errors also sometimes influence the model in a way that a in-reality-valid fold cannot be done. On the other side, for simple models and pureland origami, Origamist provides an exciting environment, and its export options are very promising (and exporting the origami as a 3D model wouldn't be complicated, which can bring a brand new set of use cases).

In the recent times, 3D technology and visualisation is spreading all over the world in a high speed, so I hope Origamist will be a part of this 3D wave and that it will help more people fold (at least virtually) nicer and more complicated origami models, because the art of origami is just amazing.
